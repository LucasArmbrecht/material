# Part 1 - Brainstorm: Statistics

## Distributions
### Normal, ..

## Statistical Models
## Methods for Estimation
## Methods for Hypothesis Testing

# Part 2 - Brainstorm: Technologies in Biology

## microarray, sequencing, etc.

## In-class exercise 1 (3 groups): microarray, Illumina seq, other types of seq

### Goal: 
#### produce a 1 paragraph summary
#### links to a few (<5) good resources
#### submit a pull request to add to week3 repo

# Part 3 - Brainstorm: Applications/protocols in genomics

## gene expression

# Part 4 - Brainstorm: Linking Technologies to Applications to Statistics (mainstream)

## e.g., microarray -> gene expression -> normally distributed

## In-class exercise 2 (3 groups): 
### Goal: make the link between technologies, what is measured, statistical models used
### For example:
##### sequencing -> gene expression -> ?
##### sequencing -> DNA methylation -> ?
##### sequencing -> protein/DNA interactions -> ?


# Part 5 - Brainstorm: Methods/algorithms/data structures that are associated more to computer science

# Part 6 (if time permits) - Pick another technology (for example, [1]) to briefly describe in terms of the above terms
### Goal: again, make the link as above
#### submit a pull request to this file
